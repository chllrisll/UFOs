# UFOs

## Overview of the Project

The webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but we'd like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, weâ€™ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results

The web page has 5 filters.

For example in this image the data is filtered by ca (state)

## Summary
In summary, there are simplicities in a webpage like this and there are drawbacks of a page with this layout.
In short, the page layout isn't aligned. I would prefer the main body centered and the upper summary as well. I would align the upper summary and table data on the same plane and have the filters to the side. Other than those minor suggestions this web page is a good fit for its use case.
